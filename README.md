# Habit Tracking Web Application
## Project Description

The Habit Tracker application helps users build and maintain good habits by providing a simple platform to log and track their progress. Users can create new habits, view their current habits, update them, and delete those they no longer want to track. With secure login and registration, users can keep their habit data private.

The app also includes visual tools like charts to show progress and streaks over time, along with reminders to help users stay on track. Overall, the Habit Tracker encourages personal growth by making habit tracking easy and effective.
